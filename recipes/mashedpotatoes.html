    <h1>Mashed Potatoes</h1>
    <img src="potato.png"><caption>Mashed Potatoes</caption>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 potatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes, removing as many of the eyes as possible with the
        tip of your peeler. (If you prefer more rustic-looking mashed potatoes,
        keep the skin on half of them and mash them with a potato masher instead
        of a food mill or potato ricer.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Submerge the potatoes in a bowl of cold water to keep them from
        turning brown while you are chopping them.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cut the potatoes into similar-sized chunks so they will cook evenly:
        the cubes should be about 1½ to two inches wide.
      </li>

      <li>
        Put the cut potatoes in a large pot. Use a pot large enough to hold
        the potatoes with enough water to cover, plus room for the water to boil
        up without boiling over. Add salt to the water, if desired. Bring the
        water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium low.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cover the pot and simmer until potatoes are tender — about 15 to 20
        minutes. A knife tip inserted into a potato should meet no resistance;
        if the potato clings to the knife, the potatoes need to cook longer.
        When potatoes are done, remove from heat and drain immediately.
      </li>

      <li>
        Reserve the potato water if you would like to use it in place of butter
        or cream when mashing, or if you plan to make a vegetable soup stock or
        sourdough bread:
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the drained potatoes to the pot and heat over medium-high heat
        for about a minute to cook off any excess water. This guarantees your
        mashed potatoes won't be watery. Stir gently to make sure all the
        potatoes dry out. The edges will start to look white and flaky, but
        don't let the potatoes scorch. Meanwhile, heat the butter and cream in a
        small saucepan at a low temperature. (You can also use the microwave for
        this step.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Now we get to the mashing part. For this recipe, we used a food mill
        to break up the potatoes and remove any lumps. Once the potatoes have
        been passed through the mill, drizzle half of your hot cream mixture
        through and around the grate to get every last bit of potato. Gently
        stir in the remaining butter and cream.
      </li>

      <li>
        Taste the potatoes for seasoning and adjust to taste. Test for
        consistency, too: If the potatoes are too thick, add more cream. Other
        herbs and spices can be added at this point as well: chopped chives,
        Italian parsley, Parmesan cheese, crumbled bacon, roasted garlic,
        chopped scallions, or creamed leeks are all delicious additions.
      </li>
    </ul>
